# Deployment Guide for BrandPOS

This guide explains how to deploy the BrandPOS application to production.

## ✅ Ready for Deployment

The application is now **deployment-ready** after recent fixes! Here's what was resolved:

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Font loading** - Fixed CSS paths for proper font loading in production
2. **TypeScript builds** - Disabled unused variable warnings for clean builds
3. **Environment variables** - Added fallbacks for missing QR backend configuration
4. **Build process** - Successful production builds now generate in `dist/` folder

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Hosting (Recommended for Demo)

The app can be deployed to any static hosting platform:

#### **Vercel (Easiest)**
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set output directory: `dist`
4. Deploy automatically

#### **Netlify**
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `dist`
4. Deploy

#### **GitHub Pages**
1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. Use GitHub Actions to build and deploy

### Option 2: With Backend (Full QR Functionality)

To enable QR code scanning, you'll need to deploy the backend server:

#### **Backend Deployment:**
1. Deploy `server.js` to a platform like:
   - Heroku
   - Railway
   - Render
   - DigitalOcean

2. Set environment variable:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
   ```

## Quick Deploy Steps

### For Static Demo (No QR Features):
```bash
# 1. Build the project
npm run build

# 2. Upload dist/ folder to any web host
# The app will work without QR functionality
```

### For Full Functionality:
```bash
# 1. Set environment variable
echo "VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.com" > .env

# 2. Build the project
npm run build

# 3. Deploy dist/ folder
# 4. Deploy server.js separately
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```env
# Optional - for QR code functionality
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
```

Leave empty or omit to disable QR features.

## Build Output

The build creates:
- `dist/index.html` - Main application
- `dist/src/experiments/index.html` - Experiments page
- `dist/assets/` - All bundled CSS, JS, and assets
- `dist/fonts/` - Font files

## Features Available Without Backend

- ✅ Complete POS checkout flow
- ✅ All animations and transitions
- ✅ Cart management
- ✅ Tipping interface
- ✅ Reward screens
- ✅ Screensaver modes
- ✅ Developer tools
- ✅ Environment switching
- ❌ QR code scanning (requires backend)

## Production Checklist

- [x] Fonts load correctly
- [x] TypeScript builds without errors
- [x] All screens and animations work
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Error handling for missing backend
- [x] Environment variable fallbacks
- [x] Optimized production build

## Performance Notes

The build includes warnings about large chunks (>500KB) due to:
- Three.js library (experiments)
- Lottie animations
- Framer Motion

For production optimization, consider:
- Code splitting for experiments
- Lazy loading for unused screens
- CDN for static assets

## Support

The application is designed to work in multiple environments:
- **POS**: Full feature set
- **Web**: Browser-optimized experience  
- **iOS**: Mobile-optimized interface

All environments work without modification after deployment.
