# Commenting Standards

## Component Documentation
Each component file should include clear, descriptive comments that outline its structure and behavior.

### Section Blocks
Use descriptive block comments to separate major sections:
```tsx
{/* Header Container */}
{/* Left side: Avatar and Title */}
{/* Right side: Interactive Elements */}
```

### Animation Documentation
Document animation sequences with timing and behavior:
```tsx
{/* Button animation:
  - Initial: Scale 0.7, opacity 0
  - Animate to: Scale 1.0, opacity 1
  - Duration: 0.5s, delay 0.2s
  - Ease: [0.32, 0.72, 0, 1]
*/}
```

### Layout Structure
Document complex layouts and their relationships:
```tsx
{/* Grid layout: 3 columns
  - Equal width columns
  - 12px gap between items
  - Full height of container
*/}
```

### Interactive Elements
Document user interaction patterns:
```tsx
{/* Local Cash Button:
  - Expands from icon-only (56px) to full width
  - Text slides in from right
  - Icon remains fixed in position
  - 8px gap between text and icon
*/}
```

## Comment Guidelines
Comments should:
- Be concise but descriptive
- Explain the "why" when not obvious
- Group related elements
- Highlight important animation or interaction details
- Use consistent formatting and indentation
- Focus on complex logic or non-obvious implementations

## Formatting
- Use consistent indentation for nested comments
- Keep related comments close to their code
- Use blank lines to separate major sections
- Maintain a hierarchy of information (major sections → subsections → details)

## When to Comment
Add comments for:
- Complex animations or transitions
- Non-obvious layout decisions
- State management logic
- Conditional rendering
- Custom hooks or utilities
- Accessibility implementations
- Performance optimizations
