# Animation Rules and Guidelines

## Timing Constants
- Standard fade duration: 0.3s
- Screen transition duration: 0.2s
- Spring animation config: { stiffness: 300, damping: 30 }
- Delayed animations start: 0.2s after parent mount

## Layout Transitions
- Use Framer Motion's `layoutId` for continuous element transitions between screens
- Maintain aspect ratios and dimensions during transitions
- Device frame dimensions: 800px x 500px (never animate these)

## Opacity Transitions
- Enter animations: fade from 0 to 1
- Exit animations: fade from 1 to 0
- Background overlays: fade to full opacity (1)
- Content transitions: 0.3s duration with easing

## Motion Patterns
- Card expansions: spring animation with { stiffness: 200, damping: 25 }
- Button interactions: scale to 0.90 on tap
- Sliding animations: spring with { stiffness: 300, damping: 30 }

## Timing Sequences
- Lottie animations: respect their natural duration (e.g., 2.47s for CashBack)
- Coordinated animations: ensure all elements complete together
- Stagger children animations by 0.1s when in sequence

## Best Practices
1. Always use `AnimatePresence` for exit animations
2. Coordinate related animations using consistent delay timings
3. Use spring animations for natural movement
4. Avoid nested animation containers that could conflict
5. Match animation timing to user interaction speed
6. Use consistent easing: [0.32, 0.72, 0, 1] for standard transitions

## Device Frame Rules
- Maintain 800x500 dimensions
- Keep rounded corners (rounded-2xl)
- Overlays should match frame dimensions
- Content should never overflow frame

## Performance
- Use `will-change` sparingly and only for complex animations
- Prefer opacity/transform animations over layout properties
- Group related animations to reduce reflows
- Use `mode="wait"` on AnimatePresence when animations could conflict

## Specific Components
### ExpandingCard
- Initial state: centered in container
- Expanded state: fills device frame (800x500)
- Content transitions: coordinated with card expansion
- Background color transition: 0.3s duration

### Screen Transitions
- Default: slide horizontally with spring animation
- Instant transitions: no animation for specific flows (Cart â†’ TapToPay)
- Maintain content position during transitions
