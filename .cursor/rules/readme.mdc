 # README Documentation Rule

## Purpose
Ensure every component, feature, or major directory has a clear, up-to-date README file. This helps all contributors (and your future self) quickly understand usage, props, and recent changes.

## When to Update the README
- When creating a new component, feature, or directory
- After any significant code change, new feature, or API update
- When changing or deprecating props, usage, or behavior
- Whenever you find the README is unclear or out of date

## What to Include
- **Description:** What does this component/feature do? What problem does it solve?
- **Usage Example:** Show a minimal, real-world usage snippet
- **Props/API:** List and describe all props, options, or configuration
- **Customization:** Note any theming, slots, or advanced usage
- **Changelog (optional):** Summarize recent changes if helpful
- **TODOs (optional):** Note planned improvements or missing docs

## Style Guidelines
- Be concise, but clear and complete
- Use code blocks for examples
- Use lists or tables for props
- Use plain language—assume the reader is new to the codebase
- Keep the README as the single source of truth for usage

## Example Structure
```
# ComponentName

A short description of what this component does.

## Usage
```tsx
<ComponentName prop1="foo" />
```

## Props
- `prop1`: string — Description
- `prop2`: boolean — Description

## Changelog
