# UI Modification Rules

## Core Principle
**No visual changes should be made without explicit user approval.**

## Specific Guidelines

1. **No Unauthorized UI Changes**:
   - Do not make any visual or UI changes without explicit direction
   - This includes colors, sizes, spacing, animations, text, labels, or any visual element
   - Respect the existing design system and visual language

2. **Suggestion Protocol**:
   - You may suggest UI improvements when relevant
   - All suggestions must be presented as options, not implementations
   - Wait for explicit approval before implementing any UI change

3. **Functional Focus**:
   - When fixing functionality issues, preserve existing UI design
   - Modify UI-related code only when required for functional fixes
   - Maintain visual consistency with surrounding components

4. **Explicit Approval Required For**:
   - Adding or removing UI elements
   - Changing animation timing or behavior
   - Modifying color schemes or typography
   - Altering component sizes or layouts
   - Changing text content or labels
   - Adding any new visual elements

5. **Animation-Specific Rules**:
   - Do not modify animation timing without approval
   - Preserve existing animation sequences
   - Respect animation duration constants
   - Do not add new animations without direction

6. **Exception**: Bug fixes that restore intended UI behavior may be implemented, but must be clearly noted.

## Implementation Workflow
1. Identify UI-related code
2. Analyze existing patterns and styles
3. If UI modification is required, request explicit approval
4. After approval, implement minimally invasive changes
5. Document all visual changes made
